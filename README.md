#What is 'mose'?

**mose** is a visualization tool for iRacing car setup files. 
You can see the difference between two or more setup files simultaneously, quickly and visually.

#Concept

For beginners, it's really tough to create good setup because they have to learn a lot of theory and
plenty of experience by their own is needed.
On the other hand, there are some nice setups created by talented and/or experienced drivers on
the forum week by week.
That is chance to learn what difference makes different speed and/or handling of the car.
**mose** would help you to do this process.
